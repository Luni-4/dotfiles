# Luni's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, feel free to use them as you like.
The files are handled by GNU/Stow. You can install it with this command:

    sudo apt install stow

If you want to install the packages' dotfiles into your `$HOME`, you must run the `install` script in this way:

    python install [package 1] [package 2] .... [package n]

If no argument is specified, the script will install all packages.
